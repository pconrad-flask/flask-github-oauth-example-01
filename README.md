# pconrad-flask/flask-github-oauth-example-01



Requires:

```
pip install Flask-OAuthlib
pip install PyGithub
```

# To get this working

Copy env.sh.sample to env.sh

```
cp env.sh.sample env.sh
```

Then edit env.sh to put in your own "CLIENT ID" and "CLIENT SECRET".

You'll get those values by creating an OAuth App in your Github Settings,
as described here:
